            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a
            Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
            Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
            Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local
            mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry
            that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
            uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and
            one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy traders and
            landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Their
            business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the
            island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between
            the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family acquired the title of
            “Mara Kalam Iyakkivar” (wooden boat steerers), which over the years
            became shortened to “Marakier.” With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
            to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
            fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral
            home. By his early childhood, Kalam’s family had become poor; at an
            early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family’s income.

              Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
              sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers:
              Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (born 4 November 1916),
              Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995). He was
              extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
              throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to
              his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

              Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never
              owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m
              and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his
              books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a
              laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to
              his eldest brother, who survived him.
